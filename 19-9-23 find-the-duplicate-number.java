Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1



  class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
	int low = 1, high = nums.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (int) (low + (high - low) * 0.5);
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int a : nums) {
            if (a <= mid) ++cnt;
        }
        if (cnt <= mid) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return low;
}
}
